_General introduction to an Amazon product development strategy_

 
> And it all started with a fake, pretend "aspirational" press release, said Mike George, vice president of Amazon Echo, at the Churchill > Club annual award ceremony when accepting its "Magical Team" award last week.

> When someone comes up with a possible product idea, Amazon honchos ask themselves, "Can this be fundamentally important to our customers?>  Can it be game-changing? Can we do it?" he described.

> And then they try to think big, he explained:

> "We have a thing called 'working backwards.' The first thing we do is we write a press release, ignoring every technical thing we can't do for now. It's our aspirations. We also write FAQs where we identify every question we would receive as if we issued the press release. We answer the question in aspirational ways too, ignoring, for the moment, the technical hurdles. In some cases we actually build things."

> The idea is to dream about what this product could be.

> The next step is to hash out the idea between a team of experts that would potentially work on the new product. 

> "There's a team in there, in a room, debating, from vice presidents to junior software developers," he says.

_A source for the Working Backwards strategy_


The Working Backwards product definition process is all about is fleshing out the concept and achieving clarity of thought about what we will ultimately go off and build. It typically has four steps:

1. **Start by writing the Press Release**. Nail it. The press release describes in a simple way what the product does and why it exists - what are the features and benefits. It needs to be very clear and to the point. Writing a press release up front clarifies how the world will see the product - not just how we think about it internally.

2. **Write a Frequently Asked Questions document**. Here's where we add meat to the skeleton provided by the press release. It includes questions that came up when we wrote the press release. You would include questions that other folks asked when you shared the press release and you include questions that define what the product is good for. You put yourself in the shoes of someone using the product and consider all the questions you would have.

3. ** Define the customer experience**. Describe in precise detail the customer experience for the different things a customer might do with the product. For products with a user interface, we would build mock ups of each screen that the customer uses. For web services, we write use cases, including code snippets, which describe ways you can imagine people using the product. The goal here is to tell stories of how a customer is solving their problems using the product.

4. **Write the User Manual**. The user manual is what a customer will use to really find out about what the product is and how they will use it. The user manual typically has three sections, concepts, how-to, and reference, which between them tell the customer everything they need to know to use the product. For products with more than one kind of user, we write more than one user manual.

_More details on the Working Backwards strategy_

Here’s an example outline for the press release:

* Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
* Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
* Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
* Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
* Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
* Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
* How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
* Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
* Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

He also gave some advice:

* Keep it simple.
* 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs.
* Don’t make it into a spec.
* Accompany the press release with a FAQ.
* No Geek-Speak (Imagine you’re sitting on Oprah’s couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That’s “Oprah-speak”, not “Geek-speak”.)

> "If the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. "



## Quora: [Amazon (company): What is Amazon's approach to product development and product management?]( https://www.quora.com/Amazon-company-What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management )

_Offers a few more insights on Amazon's "Working Backwards" strategy._

_Not all of it makes sense or is believable. For example:_


> Developers have special variables on Amazon system called 'Jeff says'. Switching them on and off makes certain things happen.

> It's all driven by what Jeff (Bezos) says and very random overall. Not an example that ought to be followed really.
