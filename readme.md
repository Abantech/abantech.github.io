Mission:  
All about natural interaction in 3D. To be able to give people the ability to do whatever they can do in Google Sketchup (or maya or blender, or Solidworks, etc) , but to do it with the Leap controller (or similar equipment) in order to allow this interaction to be intuitive (NUI). With the mouse and keyboard, you aren't "in there" with the medium, but with our first project, we want to allow people to create their 3D models in a small fraction of the time, and with far more ease than can be done today.

Updated Greg ~ 2015-01-27

 - Updated to add NewShapeMenu button that actually works. No images yet and lots of refactoring needed to do. Not the best code I've written but had to make a lot of simplifications to resolve issues. 
 - Still having issues with the raycaster (please someone help) - isButtonPressed and isHoveringOverControls in Scripts/HandBasedActions/MenuButtons.js  
 - Need to work together with theo to show handles upon creation
