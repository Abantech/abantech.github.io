Mission:  
All about natural interaction in 3D. To be able to give people the ability to do whatever they can do in Google Sketchup (or maya or blender, or Solidworks, etc) , but to do it with the Leap controller (or similar equipment) in order to allow this interaction to be intuitive (NUI). With the mouse and keyboard, you aren't "in there" with the medium, but with our first project, we want to allow people to create their 3D models in a small fraction of the time, and with far more ease than can be done today.



Demos: 

- [NI 3D prototype (Demo)]( http://abantech.github.io/NI3DPrototype/main.html )  
- [NI 3D prototype with Physics]( http://abantech.github.io/NI3DPrototype/PhysicsEnabled.html )  
- [NI 3D prototype using NUI Navigation (not working too well yet)]( http://abantech.github.io/NI3DPrototype/NUINavigation.html )  
Source Code: [NI 3D prototype workspace]( https://github.com/Abantech/abantech.github.io/tree/master/NI3DPrototype )  

Updated Greg ~ 2015-02-26
 
 - Implemented initial version of the NI navigation which is not working too great yet but at least has some semblance of working. Still some issues, but at least it no longer flies into space (yay!)
